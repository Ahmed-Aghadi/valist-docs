## Creating the Project

If you just created an Account, you will be directed to the following page. Simply fill in the form as you did with the Account, then click `Create Project`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember: Account members can publish to any project within the account, but the addresses you add as a Project member can only publish to this project.
{% endhint %}

If you're at the dashboard view (homepage), you can click the `Create New` dropdown, and select `Project`:

Once the transaction succeeds, you will be redirected back to the dashboard where you can publish a release! ðŸš€
