## Creating the License

You can use Valist to create a Software License NFT that enables you to directly monetize your game or software fairly.\

Creating a License is very similar to creating a Project. You can set an image, and give the license a name. This name must be unique, and will be used to generate a License ID (Token ID) for later.\

Set a price here in MATIC (payment in ERC-20 coming soon), and set a description.

Once you create the License, you can navigate to your Dashboard and click the `Licenses` tab to view the License ID/Token ID you just created:

You can use this ID as an ERC1155 Token ID for checking balances. Feel free to interact with it as a standard ERC1155 contract using any of your preferred tools!
