## Publishing the Release

Now for the fun part! Let's publish a release to your new project.

To get started, click `Publish Release` from the dashboard:

To publish a release, you can select the Account and Project that it's published under, and name the release with any arbitrary tag.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend using [SemVer](https://semver.org/) or [CalVer](https://calver.org/), but you can use any versioning system you'd like (i.e., "v1" or "Pro Edition").
{% endhint %}

Click the upload box to select the files you want to upload. This will prompt you to tag each file. You can specify `os/arch` as the file tag, and Valist installers can detect the right combination. Otherwise, you can name the file anything you'd like.\
\
Once you click `Publish Release`, your files will be uploaded to IPFS and you will be prompted to sign another message.

Once the transaction succeeds, you can navigate to your Project page to download it!\
\
Clicking the `Download` dropdown will display the files that you tagged in the release.

Congratulations! You've successfully published software in an entirely web3-native way!\
\
If you're not monetizing this software directly (it's open source, free, etc), you're done!\
