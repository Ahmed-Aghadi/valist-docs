Sign-in using your preferred wallet. Valist currently supports MetaMask, WalletConnect, and passwordless email login powered by Magic.link.

Once you click `Create Account`, you will be prompted to sign a meta-transaction. This allows you to use the system without paying gas, making your life easier!
